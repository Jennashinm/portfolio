            <h2>MODU</h2>
            <hr><br>
            <p>MODU is a company website specializing in modular furniture. The objective of the project was
              to design a fully responsive website with real content, including structured pages for about, contact,
              product listing, product details, blog, and an entire process for purchasing a product, along with
              appropriate means for buyers to provide feedback.</p><hr>

            <h3>PROCESS</h3>
            <hr><br>
            <p>The team consisted of myself and one other teammate, Jalene Pang. Our roles encompassed various aspects,
              including coding, design (UI), content (UX), and user testing. We initiated the project by analyzing its
              requirements and identifying potential challenges. The analysis phase comprised several key steps.
              We began by creating the brand identity and color scheme, followed by planning the overall layout and
              pages of the website through usage of Html/Css, collaborating through Github and Gitkraken. Researching
              the content to be included on the website was crucial for providing relevant information to users.
              We then proceeded to design the pages while considering user flow and obtaining feedback from users
              and teaching teams. Final revision of little design tweaks and layout have finalized the project.</p><hr>

            <h3>CHALLENGES AND RESOLUTIONS</h3>
            <hr><br>
            <p>During the design process, challenges emerged, particularly with the blog page, which needed to
              engage users and differentiate the website from others in the industry. Through research and user
              testing, we found that integrating a blog into the website could enhance user engagement and community
              involvement, ultimately increasing the likelihood of product purchases. Another challenge arose with the
              product detail page, which initially had a confusing layout. After receiving feedback from user testing,
              we made revisions to improve usability and clarity, resulting in a layout that effectively showcased the
              product details.</p><hr>

            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
            <hr><br>
            <p>Overall, by working throughout this project, the significance lies in creating a user-friendly
              website aligned with user expectations and enhancing the overall user experience. By addressing
              challenges and iterating on the design with my team, we learned to deliver a high-quality website that
              effectively reflects MODU's brand identity.</p><hr>
