     <p><strong>#1 project: MODU company website</strong></p>

     <p>This project was created through the course IAT 339 Web design and Development.
       The project undertaken for the course IAT 339 Web Design and Development involved
       the creation of a website for MODU, a company specializing in modular furniture.</p>

     <p>The aim was to design a fully responsive website with real content, optimized for
       viewing on all devices. This included structured pages for about, contact, product
       listing, product detailed pages, blog, and an entire process for purchasing a product,
       along with appropriate means for users to provide feedback.</p>

     <p>The team consisted of myself and one other teammate, Jalene Pang.
        My role encompassed various aspects, including coding, design (UI),
        content (UX), and user testing. The process began with analyzing
        the project's requirements and identifying potential problems.</p>

     <p>One of the challenges encountered was with the blog page, which needed to engage users and set
        the website apart from others in the industry. Through research and user testing, we discovered
        that integrating a blog into the website could enhance user engagement and community involvement,
        thereby increasing the likelihood of product purchases.</p>

     <p>Another challenge was encountered with the product detail page, which initially had a confusing layout.
       After receiving feedback from user testing, we made revisions to improve usability and clarity,
       ultimately creating a layout that effectively showcased the product details.</p>

     <p>The significance of this project lies in its ability to create a user-friendly website that aligns with
        user expectations and enhances the overall user experience. By addressing challenges and continuously
        iterating on the design, we were able to deliver a high-quality website that reflects MODU's brand
        identity effectively.</p>
