            <h2>ECO GUARD</h2>
            <hr><br>
            <p> Eco Guardians is an app aimed to help people prevent wildfires
              by providing a user-friendly interface for assessing potential fire risks in their
              surroundings using scanning or camera-based technology.</p><hr>

            <h3>PROCESS</h3>
            <hr><br>
            <p>The team consisted of myself and two other teammates, Dana Alhabbash and Tiffany Jiazhen Wu.
              My role encompassed UI design, interaction design, prototyping, and research. We began by analyzing the
              project requirements and identifying potential challenges. This included conducting domain user research
              to understand the app's purpose and features. After a few weeks of designing in figma and presenting
              our ideas, we then developed an interaction framework and designed the UI to facilitate user
              interaction effectively through Protopie application. An interactive prototype was created and
              refined based on user pilot testing and feedback.</p><hr>

            <h3>CHALLENGES AND RESOLUTIONS</h3>
            <hr><br>
            <p>One challenge  faced was defining the app's necessity. Initially, there was limited perceived risk associated
              with campfires escalating into forest fires, prompting us to conduct additional research and adjust the app's
              scope. We refined the app to categorize fire levels through scanning, enabling users to identify various fire
              risks accurately. Another challenge was within the camera function, which initially seemed restrictive. Through
              research and analysis of similar applications, we adapted the scanning feature to complement the camera
              function, offering users the flexibility to choose between both options.</p><hr>

            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
            <hr><br>
            <p>Through this project, I gained insights into the importance of user-centric design
              and the role of technology in addressing real-world challenges. By focusing on enhancing user flow and
              accessibility to fire risk assessments, I learned how to prioritize user needs and create intuitive interfaces.
              Additionally, I developed skills in conducting domain research, adapting design solutions based on feedback,
              and collaborating effectively within a team setting. This project has provided me with valuable experience
              in designing applications that not only meet user needs but also contribute to enhancing safety and awareness
              in outdoor environments</p><hr>
