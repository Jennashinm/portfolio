     <p><strong>#2 project: Eco Guardian Application User interface</strong></p>

     <p>The project undertaken for the course IAT 334 Interface Design involved the creation of an application
        interface for Eco Guardians, an app targeted at helping people prevent wildfires. The context of the
        project was to design a user-friendly interface for a scanning/camera-based app that allows users to
        assess their surroundings for potential fire risks.</p>

     <p>The team consisted of myself and two other teammates, Dana Alhabbash and Tiffany Jiazhen Wu.
       My role encompassed UI design, interaction design, prototyping, and research.</p>

     <p>One challenge we encountered was specifying the need for the application. Initially, there was limited
        risk associated with campfires evolving into forest fires, prompting us to research and adjust
        the scope of the app. We refined the app to categorize fire levels through scanning,enabling users to
        identify various fire risks.</p>

     <p>Another challenge was with the camera function, which initially seemed limiting. Through research and analysis of
        other applications, we adapted the scanning feature to complement the camera function, giving users the option
        to choose both.</p>

     <p>The significance of this project lies in providing campers and hikers with an offline/online resource for quick
        personal analysis of fire risks. By enhancing user flow and providing easy access to fire risk assessments,
        users can now identify the level of risk in their surroundings and take appropriate precautions.</p>

    <h4>#2 Analysis Phase:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><a>Domain user research and choosing the intention of the app</a></li>
        <li><a>Creating the application name</a></li>
        <li><a>Creating features and interaction framework</a></li>
        <li><a>Designing the UI and the user interaction through the app</a></li>
        <li><a>Creating an interactive prototype</a></li>
        <li><a>User pilot testings and feedback refinements</a></li>
        <li><a>Redesigning the app as a final touch</a></li>
