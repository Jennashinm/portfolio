        <h2>Ethos</h2>

        <h3>Position</h3>
        <p>Developing UI/UX student seeking to be a future designer</p>


        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Hello! I am Sa young Shin, currently enrolled as a 4th year student majoring Interactive Arts
          and Technology in Simon Fraser University. As a visionary student with a passion to jump into
          the UX/UI industry, I am laying out the foundation for my future career throughout the academic
          journey by crafting websites/applications by interface design, deep-deriven user researches,wireframing
          and prototyping. To walk on the path of endless possibilities, I am approaching either collaborative or
          individual projects with dedication and creativity, contributing my skills on Adobe, Figma, HTML,
          CSS and more industry standard design tools.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>JetBrains Mono</h4>
        <p>JetBrains Mono is a monospaced typeface created exclusively for coders. JetBrains, the firm behind
           prominent IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and PhpStorm, built it. The font is intended to improve
           the coding experience by ensuring excellent readability, particularly during long coding sessions.</p>
        <p>#Professionalism #Modern and Sleek #Comfortable Reading Experience #Clarity</p>

        <h1>JETBRAINS MONO - MONO SPACE - FONT WEIGHT 400</h1>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <h4>Blue Color Palette</h4>
        <p>Blue color schemes convey tranquility, trust, and professionalism. Lighter tints, such as sky blue,
           signify tranquility, but darker tones, such as navy, imply stability and power. It also represents
           dependability and security, which is why it is often used in corporate logos and technologies.
           In contrast, darker or desaturated blues can evoke feelings of sadness or melancholy, particularly
           in art and literature. Blue is also connected with cooling and refreshment, and is frequently used in
           the branding of water-related items.</p>

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1 project: MODU company website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This project was created through the course IAT 339 Web design and Development.
            The project undertaken for the course IAT 339 Web Design and Development involved
            the creation of a website for MODU, a company specializing in modular furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The aim was to design a fully responsive website with real content, optimized for
            viewing on all devices. This included structured pages for about, contact, product
            listing, product detailed pages, blog, and an entire process for purchasing a product,
            along with appropriate means for users to provide feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The team consisted of myself and one other teammate, Jalene Pang.
            My role encompassed various aspects, including coding, design (UI),
            content (UX), and user testing. The process began with analyzing
            the project's requirements and identifying potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;One of the challenges encountered was with the blog page, which needed to engage users and set
            the website apart from others in the industry. Through research and user testing, we discovered
            that integrating a blog into the website could enhance user engagement and community involvement,
            thereby increasing the likelihood of product purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Another challenge was encountered with the product detail page, which initially had a confusing layout.
            After receiving feedback from user testing, we made revisions to improve usability and clarity,
            ultimately creating a layout that effectively showcased the product details.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The significance of this project lies in its ability to create a user-friendly website that aligns with
            user expectations and enhances the overall user experience. By addressing challenges and continuously
            iterating on the design, we were able to deliver a high-quality website that reflects MODU's brand
            identity effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p>&lt;strong&gt;#2 project: Eco Guardian Application User interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The project undertaken for the course IAT 334 Interface Design involved the creation of an application
            interface for Eco Guardians, an app targeted at helping people prevent wildfires. The context of the
            project was to design a user-friendly interface for a scanning/camera-based app that allows users to
            assess their surroundings for potential fire risks.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The team consisted of myself and two other teammates, Dana Alhabbash and Tiffany Jiazhen Wu.
            My role encompassed UI design, interaction design, prototyping, and research.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;One challenge we encountered was specifying the need for the application. Initially, there was limited
           risk associated with campfires evolving into forest fires, prompting us to research and adjust
           the scope of the app. We refined the app to categorize fire levels through scanning,enabling users to
           identify various fire risks.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Another challenge was with the camera function, which initially seemed limiting. Through research and analysis of
           other applications, we adapted the scanning feature to complement the camera function, giving users the option
           to choose both.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The significance of this project lies in providing campers and hikers with an offline/online resource for quick
           personal analysis of fire risks. By enhancing user flow and providing easy access to fire risk assessments,
           users can now identify the level of risk in their surroundings and take appropriate precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
