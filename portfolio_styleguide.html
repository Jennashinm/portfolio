        <h2>Ethos</h2>

        <h3>Position</h3>
        <p>Developing UI/UX student seeking to be a future designer</p>


        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Hello! I am Sa young Shin, currently enrolled as a 4th year student majoring Interactive Arts
          and Technology in Simon Fraser University. As a visionary student with a passion to jump into
          the UX/UI industry, I am laying out the foundation for my future career throughout the academic
          journey by crafting websites/applications by interface design, deep-deriven user researches,wireframing
          and prototyping. To walk on the path of endless possibilities, I am approaching either collaborative or
          individual projects with dedication and creativity, contributing my skills on Adobe, Figma, HTML,
          CSS and more industry standard design tools.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>JetBrains Mono</h4>
        <p>JetBrains Mono is a monospaced typeface created exclusively for coders. JetBrains, the firm behind
           prominent IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and PhpStorm, built it. The font is intended to improve
           the coding experience by ensuring excellent readability, particularly during long coding sessions.</p>
        <p>#Professionalism #Modern and Sleek #Comfortable Reading Experience #Clarity</p>

        <h1>JETBRAINS MONO - MONO SPACE - FONT WEIGHT 400</h1>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <h4>Blue Color Palette</h4>
        <p>Blue color schemes convey tranquility, trust, and professionalism. Lighter tints, such as sky blue,
           signify tranquility, but darker tones, such as navy, imply stability and power. It also represents
           dependability and security, which is why it is often used in corporate logos and technologies.
           In contrast, darker or desaturated blues can evoke feelings of sadness or melancholy, particularly
           in art and literature. Blue is also connected with cooling and refreshment, and is frequently used in
           the branding of water-related items.</p>

        <div class="color-container">
          <div class="Pattens Blue"> <h4>Pattens Blue <span class='smaller'>#DFE3E6</span></h4></div>
          <div class="Mangolia"> <h4>Mangolia <span class='smaller'>#F2F1F6 </span></h4></div>
          <div class="Zumthor"> <h4>Zumthor <span class='smaller'>#C0D9DC</span></h4></div>

        </div>


        <h3>Logo</h3>
        <h4>Logo containing the initial of my full name</h4>

          <div class="logo-container">
            <div> <img src="img/logo1.png" alt="logo1"></div>

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1 project: MODU company website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;MODU is a company website specializing in modular furniture. The objective of the project was to  design a fully responsive website with real content, including structured pages for about, contact, product listing, product details, blog, and an entire process for purchasing a product, along with appropriate means for buyers to provide feedback.
  The team consisted of myself and one other teammate, Jalene Pang. Our roles encompassed various aspects, including coding, design (UI), content (UX), and user testing. We initiated the project by analyzing its requirements and identifying potential challenges.
  The analysis phase comprised several key steps. We began by creating the brand identity and color scheme, followed by planning the overall layout and pages of the website through usage of Html/Css, collaborating through Github and Gitkraken. Researching the content to be included on the website was crucial for providing relevant information to users. We then proceeded to design the pages while considering user flow and obtaining feedback from users and teaching teams. Final revision of little design tweaks and layout have finalized the project. During the design process, challenges emerged, particularly with the blog page, which needed to engage users and differentiate the website from others in the industry. Through research and user testing, we found that integrating a blog into the website could enhance user engagement and community involvement, ultimately increasing the likelihood of product purchases. Another challenge arose with the product detail page, which initially had a confusing layout. After receiving feedback from user testing, we made revisions to improve usability and clarity, resulting in a layout that effectively showcased the product details.
  Overall, by working throughout this project,  the significance lies in creating a user-friendly website aligned with user expectations and enhancing the overall user experience. By addressing challenges and iterating on the design with my team, we learned to deliver a high-quality website that effectively reflects MODU's brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;


          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2 project: Eco Guardian Application User interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &ltp&gt; Eco Guardians is an app aimed to help people prevent wildfires by providing a user-friendly interface for assessing potential fire risks in their surroundings using scanning or camera-based technology.
  The team consisted of myself and two other teammates, Dana Alhabbash and Tiffany Jiazhen Wu. My role encompassed UI design, interaction design, prototyping, and research.
  We began by analyzing the project requirements and identifying potential challenges. This included conducting domain user research to understand the app's purpose and features. After a few weeks of designing in figma and presenting our ideas, we then developed an interaction framework and designed the UI to facilitate user interaction effectively through Protopie application. An interactive prototype was created and refined based on user pilot testing and feedback.
  One challenge  faced was defining the app's necessity. Initially, there was limited perceived risk associated with campfires escalating into forest fires, prompting us to conduct additional research and adjust the app's scope. We refined the app to categorize fire levels through scanning, enabling users to identify various fire risks accurately. Another challenge was within the camera function, which initially seemed restrictive. Through research and analysis of similar applications, we adapted the scanning feature to complement the camera function, offering users the flexibility to choose between both options.
  Through this project, I gained insights into the importance of user-centric design and the role of technology in addressing real-world challenges. By focusing on enhancing user flow and accessibility to fire risk assessments, I learned how to prioritize user needs and create intuitive interfaces. Additionally, I developed skills in conducting domain research, adapting design solutions based on feedback, and collaborating effectively within a team setting. This project has provided me with valuable experience in designing applications that not only meet user needs but also contribute to enhancing safety and awareness in outdoor environments&lt/p&gt;
